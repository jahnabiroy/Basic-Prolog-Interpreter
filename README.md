# Basic-Prolog-Interpreter
A basic prolog interpreter implemented using OCaml. 

## Instructions to use the interpreter

- clone the repo into your local.
- run `make` to build the interpreter.
- use command `./main Tests/test1.pl` to run test 1 in the tests folder. You can replace the location with the location where your sample tests are located.

**This is a basic implementation, pardon mistakes!**
